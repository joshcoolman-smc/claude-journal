## Voice-to-Journal: A Simple Alternative to Note-Taking Apps

All right, you might be asking, "What the heck is this repo?" Well, it's pretty simple really. I was just trying to find an easy way to journal and I was sick of Notion. I was sick of all the note-taking apps out there. And I thought, "Man, there must be a better way." So I just talked to Claude and came up with some rules. What I do is use my voice to journal and dictate a bunch of stuff - that's what you're reading here - into the README at the top of the file. When I'm done with that stuff, I just tell Claude, "Capture this" and it goes to work, formatting it, summarizing some bullet points, putting a date on it, and committing the changes and pushing to the repo. So that's what this is. If that's useful to you, be my guest, have fun, take a look at the CLAUDE.md file - you'll see how it works. I think that should do it. Just feel free to delete this entry in the README and do your own journal. Anyway, I hope you have fun with it. If this is useful to you, that's great. If not, this is just a way for me to share with my friends.

• Created a simple journaling system using voice dictation and Claude
• Eliminates the complexity of traditional note-taking apps like Notion
• Uses README.md as the journal file with voice-to-text capture
• Automated formatting and Git operations via Claude commands
• Designed for simplicity and sharing with friends
