## A Streamlined Guide to Voice Journaling with Claude

All right, this is just a quick post on how to use this file. Basically, all you do is open the README, put your cursor at the top of the file above all the dated entries, and use some voice dictation or type if you like. Whatever you say will be recorded in the README. Then, pop open Claude Code and say "Capture this" - it will think of a clever title and add a date. It will also extract a few points from whatever you blabbered on about. Finally, it will commit those changes to the README and push to your repo. And then you just rinse and repeat, placing your cursor above the last date and keeping on journaling.

So there you go, that's all there is to it. You realize, don't you, that software is dead?

Power user tip: set VSCode to autosave, so you don't have to remember to do that. It can be frustrating if you forget to save and Claude gets confused. Happy journaling!

• Simple workflow: open README, add text at top, say "Capture this"
• Claude handles formatting, dating, and Git operations automatically
• Voice dictation recommended for effortless thought capture
• Pro tip: enable VSCode autosave to avoid losing unsaved content
• Philosophical aside: "software is dead"

## Voice-to-Journal: A Simple Alternative to Note-Taking Apps

All right, you might be asking, "What the heck is this repo?" Well, it's pretty simple really. I was just trying to find an easy way to journal and I was sick of Notion. I was sick of all the note-taking apps out there. And I thought, "Man, there must be a better way." So I just talked to Claude and came up with some rules. What I do is use my voice to journal and dictate a bunch of stuff - that's what you're reading here - into the README at the top of the file. When I'm done with that stuff, I just tell Claude, "Capture this" and it goes to work, formatting it, summarizing some bullet points, putting a date on it, and committing the changes and pushing to the repo. So that's what this is. If that's useful to you, be my guest, have fun, take a look at the CLAUDE.md file - you'll see how it works. I think that should do it. Just feel free to delete this entry in the README and do your own journal. Anyway, I hope you have fun with it. If this is useful to you, that's great. If not, this is just a way for me to share with my friends.

• Created a simple journaling system using voice dictation and Claude
• Eliminates the complexity of traditional note-taking apps like Notion
• Uses README.md as the journal file with voice-to-text capture
• Automated formatting and Git operations via Claude commands
• Designed for simplicity and sharing with friends
